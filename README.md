Website details our project "Determination of Cardiac Volumes using MRI Images".

Diagnosing cardiac anomalies is a leading issue faced by medical researchers, and several methods have been used to estimate a heart’s “Cardiac-Output”, ie, the volume of the ventricles, in both active (systolic) and resting (diastolic) states. The incentive behind doing so is to be able to effectively calculate the heart’s ejection fraction (EF), defined as the percentage of blood ejected from the left ventricle with each heartbeat. The ventricles’ volumes and the EF together are predictive of a number of heart diseases. While multiple modalities can measure volumes/EF, calculating them from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRIs) yield the best results. However, the current standard for the estimation of ventricle volumes is to have a cardiologist calculate them manually from MRIs in a rather time-consuming process. Automating this process will allow doctors to diagnose heart conditions early/better, and carries broad implications for advancing the science of heart disease treatment.
